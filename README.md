# CMU_FoodIST

This project is part of the Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing course of 2019/2020.

From the course page:
> This application will explore several key aspects to mobile development, including location awareness, judicious use of limited resources, and social behavior. Towards this end you will be developing a simple App to help your fellow students decide where to eat on campus: FoodIST .

This repository contains:
1) A non-trivial mobile application for the Android Operating System, explained before.

2) A simple gRPC server to allow storing the app's data in the cloud and a few other features.
